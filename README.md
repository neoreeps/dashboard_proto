# Dashboard Prototype and Playground
This is just a simple site for playing with creating custom dashboards.  I found that most tools available are over engineered and dont easily fit the vision i have for what i want.

# Streamlit
Currently using streamlit and experimenting.

# HTML
html based site.

# Tools

## browser-sync
This is a great tool for monitoring your changes live as you develop.  It will "watch" a directory and auto refresh a browser window running your code.

It has many optons but this is the simple command i use.
```
browser-sync start --server --directory --files “*” --watch
```
